## Yeah I got Issues...
...but you got 'em too.
[So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you](https://github.com/kysely/urstatus/issues)

## Develop

Written in Python 3, runs on [`rumps`](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps).

I believe the code is self-explanatory; and few less comprehensible parts are
documented, so editing the source should be fairly easy.


```sh
# Run development version
make run

# Build .app file
make build
```
